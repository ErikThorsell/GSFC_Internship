    \section{Weeks 3-7: Our First Project}

    \begin{frame}{Problem Description}
        Rewrite how globl/solve handles its passing of data to and from
        usrpartials and usrprogs.

        By minimizing disc I/O we want to increase the speed at which data is
        sent.

    \begin{frame}{I/O Performance}
    \begin{itemize}[<+-|alert@+>]
        \item A couple of contenders:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Read/Write with files
                \item Read/Write with pipes
                \item Sending/Receiving with TCP Sockets
                \item Sending/Receiving with OpenMPI
                \item Sending/Receiving with ZeroMQ
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
%%
    \begin{frame}{Performance Test}
        \begin{enumerate}[<+-|alert@+>]
            \item The producer generates a list of length n and fills it with
                  integers.
            \item The producer writes the list to file (or sends it over the
                  designated transfer protocol).
            \item The consumer reads (or receives) the list.
            \item The consumer squares each int in the list and sends it back
                  to the producer.
            \item The producer reads (or receives) the modified list.
        \end{enumerate}

    \begin{frame}{Result for I/O Performance}
    \begin{itemize}[<+-|alert@+>]
        \item TCP was the fastest, but the most difficult to implement.
        \item Since we assumed a lot of data would be passed we opted for ZeroMQ
              due to its presumptive ease of use and performance.

            \item Posix Shared Memory? Conversion between C and Fortran was non trivial.

    \section{Weeks 7-9: Our Second Project}

    \begin{frame}{Problem Description}
        The model used for determining when an antenna acquires a source is a
        little bit off. Sked will say that an antenna should be on target at
        time $T$ but the logfiles tells us that the antenna actually was on
        source at $T \pm c$.

        During our time here we have:
        \pause
        \begin{itemize}[<+-|alert@+>]
            \item been exposed to how it is to work at NASA and NVI.
            \item learned the importance of conducting thorough research.
            \item realized that patience really is a virtue...
