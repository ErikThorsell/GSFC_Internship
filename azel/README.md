# Calculate Slew

A simple way to calculate the slew time for an arbitrary VLBI (AZ/EL) antenna.


## Requirements

- A folder that contains the .log-files as well as the .azel-file for an
  arbitrary session. The log files should be named ``<session>.log`` and the
  azel file ``<session>.azel``. The creation of the azel files are explained
  in section `Generate .azel`.

    - **Note:** Defining the path as ``/500/year/*`` will give the result for
      all sessions in that year. This is the "higest level" possible at the
      moment. ``/500/*`` is not a valid path.

- That trakl or flagr is turned on for the antenna.

- An up-to-date version of the file ``antenna.cat`` that holds a sumary of all
  the antennas' specifications. This file should be placed in ``src/``, or the
  path in calculate_slew.sh should be changed.

- The Python library [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/, "Numpy") in order to find
  the least square solution.

- The Python library [mathplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/, "Mathplotlib") in
  order to utilize the ``--graph`` flag and get good looking graphs. (More
  about this below.)



## Run the program

``sh calculate_slew.sh``, runs the program. The user is faced with an
interactive program that prompts the user for a couple of paths. The program
also asks if graphs should be generated or not.

**Note:** ``calculate_slew 3.0`` will feature a "commandline only mode" s.t.
the script can be run as part of other scripts.


### House keeping

There are two programs that run before ``./calculate_slew.sh``.

1. ``src/getStationSpecs.py`` pulls the antennas' specifications from the file
   ``antenna.cat``.

2. ``src/create_extract.py`` also uses ``antenna.cat``, it creates the file
   ``extract.py`` and ensures all the antennas in ``antenna.cat`` can be used.

**Note:** If you have limited disk space, or are simply reluctant to waste
space and time, remove the antennas not in use from *your copy of*
``antenna.cat`` before running the scripts above.

## Output from the program

The program stores two ``.dat``-files for each antenna. The files are named
``<station>_az.dat`` and ``<station>_el.dat`` depending on if azimuth or
elevation is calculated. ``data/`` also contains the file ``lsq_result.dat``
which holds the desired least square solution for each antenna, i.e. the
antenna speed and offset.

If the user wishes to generate graphs all of the above is true, but the program
also stores graphs showing the solution for each antenna - both in azimuth and
elevation. These graphs are stored in ``img/``.

## Generate .azel

The ``.azel``-files are generated by the following commands:

``$> sked <session>.skd``

``sked> xl wrap``

``sked> unit <session>.azel``

``sked> li ^-*``

``sked> q``

``$> mv <session>.azel /path/to/calculate_slew/skds/``

This can be done automatically, but is outside the scope of our knowledge at
the moment.
